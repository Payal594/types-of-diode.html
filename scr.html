<title>SCR - Silicone Controlled Rectifier</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Silicone Controlled Rectifier (SCR)</h1>
<p>The SCR is  a three terminal thyristor that acts like a silicon rectifier diode whose conductor is controlled by an input current. The symbol is similar to that of a diode with a cathode and an anode. Note that the third element of the SCR is known as the gate.The SCR will conduct current between cathode and anode, but only if proper control current is applied to the gate.. The gate must be made positive with respect to the cathode for the
    SCR to conduct. When conducting, the SCR acts like a closed switch. The
    voltage drop across the cathode and anode will be approximately 0.7– 1.8
    V, depending on the size of the SCR and how much current is flowing
    through it. When the cathode and anode are reverse biased, current will not
    flow through the device.
     An SCR conducts when a gate pulse is applied to it, just like a
    diode. It has four layers of semiconductors that form two structures namely;
    NPNP or PNPN. In addition, it has three junctions labeled as J1, J2 and J3 are three terminals anode,cathode and gate. </p>

    <h2> Modes of operations in SCR</h2>
    <p>In SCR there are three junctions J1, J2 and J3 . These
        junctions play a very important role in the operation of SCR.
        Depending on whether the junctions are forward biased or reverse
        biased, the SCR will either conduct the current or will not be
        conducted. For SCR to conduct current, all the three junctions
        must be forward biased. If any one of the junctions is reverse
        biased the SCR will not conduct any current and hence acts as an
        open switch. This can be explained by considering the following cases.</p>
    <p><b>a. Reverse Blocking:</b>  In this Case the Positive Voltage is
        given to Cathode and Negative Voltage is given to Cathode
        and Gate is Open Circuited. In this case, the junction J1 and
        J3 are reverse biased, whereas J2 is forward biased. As the
        Junctions J1 and J3 are reverse biased so there will be no
        Current, But there will be Small leakages in the Forward
        Junction J2 As the leakage current is Very Small which will
        not Turn on SCR. Hence the SCR will be in OFF State.</p>

    <p><b> OFF State(Forward Blocking Mode):</b>In this case,
        Positive Voltage is Given to Anode and Negative Voltage is
        Given to the Cathode and Gate is Open Circuited. The
        
        junction J2 is reverse biased, whereas junctions J1 and J3
        are forward biased, Because of the Reverse Bias Voltage the
        Width of the Depletion Region which Block the Flow of
        Current Between J1 and J3.Again due to which the SCR
        does not conduct and acts as an open switch.</p>

        <p> <b> ON State(Conduction mode)</b>The SCR will Conduct
            Current By Increasing Forward Bias Voltage Above the
            Break Down Voltage and By Applying Positive Voltage at
            gate terminal. In this case, all the three junctions are
            forward biased and hence SCR gets turned ON and starts
            conducting. Here, the SCR acts as a closed switch.</p>

        <p><h2>V-I Characteristics of SCR:</h2>
            The V-I characteristics of SCR is shown in the below figure. The
            horizontal line in the below figure represents the amount of voltage
            applied across the SCR whereas the vertical line represents the
            amount of current flows in the SCR.
             <b>VA = Anode voltage, IA = Anode current, +VA = Forward
            anode voltage, +IA = Forward anode current, -VA = Reverse
            anode voltage, +IA = Reverse anode current</b></p>

        <main>
            <p> The V-I characteristics of SCR is divided into three regions. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Forward Blocking Region </li>
                <li>Forward Conduction Region </li>
                <li>Reverse Blocking Region</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Forward blocking region:</b>
                In this region, the positive voltage (+) is given to anode
               (+), negative voltage (-) is given to cathode (-), and gate is open
               circuited. Due to this the junction J1 and J3 become forward
               biased while J2 become reverse biased. Therefore, a small
               leakage current flows from anode to cathode terminals of the SCR.
               This small leakage current is known as forward leakage current.
                The region OA of V-I characteristics is known as forward
               blocking region in which the SCR does not conduct electric
               current.
               <hr>
               <b>Forward Conduction region:</b>
                If the forward bias voltage applied between anode and
               cathode is increased beyond the breakdown voltage, the minority
               carriers (free electrons in anode and holes in cathode) gain large
               amounts of energy and accelerate to greater velocities. This high
               speed minority carrier collides with other atoms and generates more charge carriers. Likewise, many collisions happen with
               atoms. Due to this, millions of charge carriers are generated. As a
               result depletion region breakdown occurs at junction J2 and
               current starts flowing through the SCR. So the SCR will be in one
               state. The current flow in the SCR increases rapidly after junction
               breakdown occurs.
                The voltage at which the junction J2 gets broken when the
               gate is open is called forward breakdown voltage (VBF).
               
                The region BC of the V-I characteristics is called
               conduction region. In this region, the current flowing from anode to
               cathode increases rapidly. The region AB indicates that as soon as
               the device becomes on, the voltage across the SCR drops to
               some volts.
               <hr>
               <b>Reverse Blocking Region:</b>
                In this region, the negative voltage (-) is given to anode
               (+), positive voltage (+) is given to cathode (-), and the gate is
               open circuited. In this case, the junction J1 and junction J3 are
               reverse biased whereas the junction J2 becomes forward biased.
                As the junctions J1 and junction J3 are reverse
               biased, no current flows through the SCR circuit. But a small
               leakage current flows due to drift of charge carriers in the forward
               biased junction J2. This small leakage current is called reverse
               leakage current. This small leakage current is not sufficient to turn
               on the SCR.
                If the reverse bias voltage applied between anode and
               cathode is increased beyond the reverse breakdown voltage
               (VBR), an avalanche breakdown occurs. As a result, the current
               
               increases rapidly. The region EF is called the reverse avalanche
               region. This rapid increase in current may damage the SCR</p>
