<h1>Zener Diode</h1>
<p>A Zener Diode, also referred to as a breakdown diode, is a specially doped semiconductor
    device engineered to function in the reverse direction. When the voltage across a Zener diodeâ€™s
    terminals is reversed and reaches the Zener Voltage (also known as the knee voltage), the
    junction experiences a breakdown, allowing current to flow in the opposite direction. This
    phenomenon, known as the Zener Effect, is a key characteristic of Zener diodes.
     It is a highly doped semiconductor device specifically designed to function in
    the reverse direction. It is engineered with a wide range of Zener voltages (Vz), and certain types
    are even adjustable to achieve variable voltage regulation.</p>
    <h3>Symbol:</h3>
    <p>The symbol used to represent a Zener diode in circuit diagrams is similar to that of a regular
        diode, but with a unique addition. It consists of a triangle or arrowhead pointing towards the
        cathode side (the side with the band) of the diode. This triangle is accompanied by two
        perpendicular lines at the cathode end, one extending upwards and the other extending
        downwards. These lines indicate the specific behaviour of the Zener diode and help distinguish it
        from other types of diodes in circuit diagrams. The symbol provides a visual representation that
        allows engineers and technicians to easily identify and understand the presence of a zener diode in a circuit.</p>

        <h3> Working Principle of Zener diode</h3>
        <p> The working principle is such that if the reverse bias voltage is less than the breakdown voltage,
            or if it is forward biased then it acts as an ordinary diode. This means that forward bias allows
            current to flow and reverse bias blocks the current from flowing. After this, the voltage surpasses
            the breakdown point in reverse bias, and the diode falls in the Zener region, where it gets
            conducted without getting damaged. Current in this region is known as avalanche current but for
            a Zener diode, it is also known as a Zener current.
            When the voltage decreases in the circuit the diode maintains its non-conducting condition and
            gets back to its natural properties. This specific property of the Zener diode of being functional
            in the reverse bias and with avalanche current is given by the rich doping of the semiconductor
            material present in it.</p>

            <h3>Avalanche Breakdown</h3>
            <p>Avalanche breakdown occurs in a Zener diode when the reverse bias voltage is
                increased to a point where the electric field across the depletion region becomes strong enough
                to knock electrons from their valence bonds into the conduction band. These electrons then
                collide with other atoms, knocking more electrons free, and the process continues in a chain
                reaction known as an avalanche. This avalanche of electrons causes a sudden increase in current
                through the diode, and the voltage across the diode drops to a constant value known as the
                breakdown voltage.</p>
               <h3> Zener Breakdown</h3>
               <p>  Zener breakdown is a tunneling effect that occurs in a Zener diode with a narrow
                depletion region. When the reverse bias voltage is increased to a point where the electric field across the depletion region is strong enough, some of the valence electrons in the p-type
                material can tunnel through the depletion region and into the conduction band of the n-type
                material. This tunneling of electrons causes a sudden increase in current through the diode, and
                the voltage across the diode drops to a constant value known as the breakdown voltage.</p>
                <h3> V-I Characteristics</h3>
                <p>The V-I characteristics of a Zener diode are divided into two parts which are mentioned as
                    follows:</p>

 <h3> Forward Characteristics of Zener Diode</h3>
<p> The first quadrant of the graph depicts the forward characteristics of a Zener diode, and from
which we can understand that it is almost similar to the forward characteristics of any other
normal PN junction diode.</p>
 <h3>Reverse Characteristics of Zener Diode</h3>
 <p>When a reverse voltage is applied to a Zener voltage, a small reverse saturation current which is I
flows across the whole diode. This current is present due to thermally generated minority
 carriers present in the diode. As the reverse voltage starts to increase, at a certain value of
reverse voltage the reverse current also starts to increase drastically and sharply.
This is proof that the breakdown in the diode has occurred. This voltage is known as breakdown
voltage in zener diode or Zener voltage and is denoted by Vz. Its range is also mentioned in the
above characteristics.</p>
