<h1>Tunnel diode</h1>
<p>The tunnel diode is also known as the “Esaki Diode”. It was invented by “Leo Esaki” in 1957, and
    for this invention, received the he received Nobel in 1973. It exhibits negative resistance,
    negative resistance means current decreases when voltage increases.
     A tunnel diode is a very heavily doped p-n junction diode. In a Tunnel diode electric current
    decreases as the applied voltage increases, and at high voltage, it works as an ordinary p-n
    junction diode. In the Tunnel Diode, electric current is due to the “Tunneling effect”. Due to its
    fast switching ability, it is used in high-frequency oscillators and amplifiers. Due to the tunneling
    effect, charge carries moves across the depletion layer at very low voltage. The circuit shown
    below is the symbolic diagram of the Tunnel diode. In tunnel diode p-terminal acts as an anode and n-terminal acts as a cathode. </p>

    <h2>Working of tunnel diode</h2>
    <p>Width of the depletion region depends on the level of doping in semiconductor materials, If the
        doping level is high then the width of the depletion region is thin and if the doping level is low
        then width of depletion layer is more. In tunnel diode the width of the depletion region is very
        thin(because tunnel diode is very highly doped semiconductor device), thus when low voltage is
        applied across the terminal in forward biasing electron moves across the depletion from n-type
        semiconductor towards p-type semiconductor.</p>

        <p><b>1. Unbiased condition or unbiased tunnel diode</b>
                  <br>
                  At unbiased condition means when no voltage is applied band of n-type is overlapped with the ptype semiconductor material, due to heavy doping.
                  Because of overlapping the electron of conduction band of n-type and the hole of valence
                 band of p-type are nearly at same level. thus when temperature increase some electron tunnel
                 from conduction band of n-type to valence band of p-type and some hole tunnel from valence
                 band p-type to conduction band n-type semiconductor material, but the current flow is zero
                 because the number of tunneled electron and holes are same but in opposite direction.</p>

                 <p><b>2. In Forward Biased Condition (Some positive voltage is applied across tunnel diode)</b>
                    <br>
                    When a small positive voltage is applied less than the potential of the depletion region. In this
                    condition some of the electron of conduction band of n-type tunnel in empty valence band of ptype, this creates a small current flow through the diode.</p>

                    <p><b>3. At Vp (voltage is increased further)</b>
                        <br>
                        When voltage is increased a large number of free electron at n-side and holes at p-side
                        generates. Because of the increase in voltage the over lapping is increased. Energy level of
                        conduction band of n-type is exactly equal to the energy level of valence band at p-type result
                        maximum tunnel current flow</p>

                        <p><b>4. If applied voltage is more than peak voltage(V>Vp)</b>
                            <br>
                            When we further increase the voltage more than the peak voltage, the energy level of conduction
                            band at n-side and the valence band at p-side misalign. Due to this misalignment tunneling of
                            charge carrier decreases, as result decrease in tunnel current.If the applied voltage is increased largely then the tunnel diode behaves like an ordinary diode,
                            and show zero tunnel current and maximum diode current. If the applied voltage is greater than
                            the voltage of the depletion layer the tunnel current start decreasing till the valley voltage level
                            after that current increase exponentially. </p>
