<h1>Varactor diode</h1>
<p>Varactor diodes or Varicap diodes are semiconductor devices that are widely used in the
    electronics industry. They are also used within the RF design arena. In this article, we will learn
    about the characteristics and applications of the varactor diode.
     Varactor diode is a type of diode whose internal capacitance varies with respect to the reverse
    voltage. It always works in reverse bias conditions and is a voltage-dependent semiconductor
    device. Several names know varactor diode as Varicap, Voltcap, Voltage variable capacitance, or
    Tunning diode.
   <h2><b> Symbol of Varactor Diode</b></h2>
    From the diagram given below, it is evident that the symbol of the varactor diode is similar to that
    of the PN-junction diode. The diode has two terminals: anode and cathode. One end of the
    symbol consists of the diode, and the other has two parallel lines representing the capacitor’s
    conductive plates. The gap between the plates shows their </p>

    <h2>Construction of Varactor diode</h2>
    <p>
        The construction of a varactor diode is similar to a regular p-n junction diode, with some
       additional characteristics. These are added to ensure it shows characteristics of variable
       capacitance.
        The integral part of Varactor diodes is typically made from semiconductor materials like silicon
       (Si) or gallium arsenide (GaAs). Silicon varactors are commonly used because they have a lower
       capacitance range.
        A varactor diode typically consists of a p-n junction. P-N junctions are created by adding
       impurities to semiconductor wafer (doping). The p-type region contains holes ( i.e positively
       charged carriers) and the n-type region contains electrons(negatively charged carriers).
        The p-n junction creates a depletion region at the boundary between the p-type and n-type
       regions. The width of this region depends on the kind of biasing technique used in the diode.
       When forward bias is applied this depletion region will be narrow and when reverse bias is
       applied the depletion region will be wide blocking most current flow.
        We also have metal contacts added to the p-type and n-type regions to provide electrical
       connections. These contacts allow you to apply an external voltage across the diode.</p>
       <h2>Working of Varactor diode</h2>
       <p>An important point to note is that varactor diode works in Reverse biased configuration.When a
        diode is subjected to forward bias, the majority carriers in both the p and n regions are pushed in
        the direction of the battery’s applied voltage, leading to a reduction in the width of the depletion
        region. Eventually, the diode begins to conduct current more readily. However, a varactor diode is
        designed with a specific focus on its capacitance properties and its ability to store charges. This is why it is typically operated in reverse bias. When reverse biased, the varactor diode’s
        capacitance varies with changes in the applied reverse voltage, making it useful in various
        applications like tuning circuits, frequency modulation, and voltage-controlled oscillators.</p>

        <p>Initially, when there’s no electric force applied, there’s a thin empty region at the junction
            between two different materials in a diode. But when we apply a reverse electric force by
            connecting it to a battery the wrong way, something interesting happens.<br>
            The majority carriers in both the p-region (which has positive charges called “holes”) and the nregion (which has negative charges called “electrons”) start to move away from the junction. This
            means they get pushed apart because of the electric force. As a result, there are fewer of these
            majority carriers near the junction.<br>
            So, when we increase the reverse electric force by increasing the voltage from the battery, the
            empty region, which we call the “depletion region,” gets bigger. It’s like the gap between two
            plates of a capacitor. And the depletion region behaves like an insulating material in between
            those capacitor plates. The capacitance at the junction is termed as Transition Capacitance.
            Now, here’s the important part: as we increase the reverse voltage (the electric force), the
            depletion region gets wider. And because of the formula for capacitance, when the width (W) of
            the depletion region increases, the capacitance (CT) decreases.<br>
            So, in simple terms, when we change the voltage applied to the diode, the capacitance also
            changes. It gets smaller when we increase the voltage because the gap between the plates (the
            depletion region) gets bigger.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Varactor Diode </h2>
            <p>The graph shows the non-linear relationship between capacitance and voltage applied to diode.
                It is known that capacitance and width have an inverse relationship which means that as the
                width of the depletion region increases with the reverse voltage, the capacitance decreases (i.e.
                varies inversely as shown in the graph). In short, as the reverse voltage increases, the transition capacitance falls rapidly. This behaviour
                can be describes as an exponential pattern.<br>
